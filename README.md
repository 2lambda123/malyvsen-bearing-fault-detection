# Bearing fault detection
Improving on NASA's work with induction motor bearing fault detection using RNN-powered smart sensors.

## Walkthrough
1. Run `source setup_venv.sh` to automatically setup a Python virtual environment under `bearing_venv/`.
1. Run `jupyter notebook nasa_tests/regression.ipynb` to see current progress. You might need to explicitly specify the kernel to be the one from `bearing_venv/`.
